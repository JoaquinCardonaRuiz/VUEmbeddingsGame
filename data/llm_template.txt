I am creating a game based around NLP and embeddings.

The player will be presented with a word, and empty textboxes for 8 other words that are similar in meaning, as chosen by proximity of their embeddings.
Their task is to type one of these similar words, based on hints. I need you to generate the hints for these words.
You should take into account that the players will be educated on linguistics, so the examples should be difficult.
Keep both hints at less than 30 words each. Please don't output any text other than the form given.

The word you need to generate hints for is: "{word}". Please fill the form below. DON'T MENTION THE WORD ITSELF IN THE HINTS.

Medium difficulty hint: <write your hint here>
Hard difficulty hint: <write your hint here>
